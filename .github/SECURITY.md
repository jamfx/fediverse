# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is supported with security updates.

I only support the latest published, stable Joomla version in the latest stable Joomla branch. O do not support Joomla alphas, betas or release candidates (testing releases). If a security issue only occurs with a testing release we will consider it, but we cannot promise a rapid resolution.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a GitHub issue about security issues. GitHub issues are public.
Filing an issue about a security issue puts all users, you included, in immediate danger.

Please use my [contact page](https://www.dionysopoulos.me/contact-me.html?view=item) to send me a
private notification about the security issue. I strongly recommend using GPG to encrypt
your email. You can find my public GPG key at https://keybase.io/nikosdion

Please include instructions to reproduce the security issue. Better yet, please include Proof
Of Concept code if applicable.

## Expected timeframe

I aim to reply within a business week (5 working days excluding bank holidays). I request a period of 60 to 90 calendar days since I receive adequate information to reproduce the issue before public disclosure, so I have time to address the security issue, publish a new version and make sure everyone is updated.

I do not have the budget for a bug bounty or any other kind of compensation for security researchers reporting security issues. I will, however, publicly credit you for the discovery of the security issue in the release notes and announcement of the security release.
